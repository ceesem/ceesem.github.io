At long last, I've moved from my old site I put up quickly on Squarespace to a new static site generated by Quarto and hosted on Github Pages. There's still a lot of work to do and I am no web designer by any stretch of the imagination, but I'm happy to have a site that I can easily update and maintain. Already, I found a fun method to use Quarto's multi-format abilities to generate both the html and pdf versions off the same markdown.
